# Inline ignore comments

Ignore comments provide an escape hatch for exceptional cases where a rule is correct in general but needs to be suppressed in a small, well scoped section of code. Inline comments override configuration files.

Oxlint supports line comments (`//`) and block comments (`/* */`). Comments must start with one of the keywords below.

## oxlint-disable

Disable one or more rules until the end of the file, or until they are re-enabled.

```js
// Disable all Oxlint rules for the rest of the file
/* oxlint-disable */

// Disable a single rule in this file
/* oxlint-disable no-console */

// Disable multiple rules in this file
/* oxlint-disable no-console, typescript/no-floating-promises */
```

## oxlint-enable

Enable one or more rules until the end of the file, or until they are disabled again.

```js
/* oxlint-enable no-console */

/* oxlint-enable no-console, no-alert */
```

## oxlint-disable-line

Disable one or more rules on the current line.

```js
console.log("Hello, world!"); // oxlint-disable-line no-console

console.log(x++); // oxlint-disable-line no-console, no-plusplus
```

## oxlint-disable-next-line

Disable one or more rules on the line following the comment, then re-enables them for subsequent lines.

```js
// oxlint-disable-next-line no-console
console.log("Hello, world!"); // allowed because of the previous comment
console.log(x++); // not allowed because the previous comment only applied to the previous line

// oxlint-disable-next-line no-console, no-plusplus
console.log("Hello, world!"); // allowed
```

## ESLint compatibility

For compatibility with existing ESLint codebases, the same keywords are supported with `oxlint` replaced by `eslint`, such as `/* eslint-disable */` and `// eslint-disable-next-line`.

The `oxlint-*` form is recommended. The `eslint-*` form is useful during migration for rules that Oxlint does not support yet.

## Rule options cannot be changed inline

Ignore comments can enable or disable rules, but they cannot change rule options. Rule options belong in configuration files.

## Report unused ignore comments

Reporting unused ignore comments is disabled by default. When enabled, Oxlint reports comments such as `// oxlint-disable-line` when no diagnostics would have been reported on that line.

Enable reporting:

```bash
oxlint --report-unused-disable-directives
```

Specify the severity:

```bash
oxlint --report-unused-disable-directives-severity error
```

Only one of these options can be used at a time.

This can also be set in the Oxlint configuration file:

::: code-group

```jsonc [.oxlintrc.json]
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/oxlint/configuration_schema.json",
  "options": {
    "reportUnusedDisableDirectives": "error", // or "off" or "warn"
  },
}
```

```ts [oxlint.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "oxlint";

export default defineConfig({
  options: {
    reportUnusedDisableDirectives: "error", // or "off" or "warn"
  },
});
```
